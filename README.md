# discord-scheduler
Allows you to send a different automated discord message every day of the week.
It's a rather simple bot but for a specific use case, therefore I had to make this bot specifically so I figured I'd share it for anyone in a similar situation.

### Installation

 1. Have Node & Npm installed.
 2. ``npm install discord.js node-cron``
 3. Edit bot.js to configure your bot token, channel ID  and your daily messages.
 4. ``node bot.js``

*Please note the week starts on  a Sunday for this bot*
